Today, along with some internal improvements and optimizations, we deployed a change which slightly changes the path of where "API Foundry" automatic API documentation can be found. The new path is cleaner, more semantic, and easier for search engines to index. The old location will automatically redirected, so it should be almost entirely transparent to you.
